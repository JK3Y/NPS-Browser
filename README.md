# Swift NPS Browser
>A macOS version of NPS Browser

I was sick of having to use Bootcamp just for this one app. So I decided to make a clone of my own as a way to give back to the community.

## Usage
* Set URLs and extraction preferences in the Preferences window
* Click the refresh button in the corner of the window to pull fresh data from the server. 

Note that the data from the server is stored until you decide to refresh the database.

## Building
Open the project in XCode using the .xcworkspace file, since this project uses CocoaPods for dependencies. Then just build and run.

## Known Bugs
* Sometimes the app will quit on launch, but runs fine after relaunching it.
